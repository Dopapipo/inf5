Main branch has low level website work


Switch to rework branch for the most final work


Functionnalities so far : 

MVC structure using OOP
Semi-responsive design (not all elements are well-done yet)
Adaptive content using database, log-in & log-out system, comment system.
Adaptive content using twig
Detailled models (Repo-Entity)
Generic methods for controllers (displayDefault() )that allow for easy routing and code maintenance

TODO :
  Allow users to only post comments when they're logged in
  Allow users to delete their own comments
  Make admin account that can delete every comment
  Better design for logged-in users
  Probably refactor twig templates a bit, because it's getting hard to maintain. Use more blocks inside blocks.
